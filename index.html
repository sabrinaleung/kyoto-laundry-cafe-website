     <h3>
    Menu
    </h3>
     <p> 
    We have an assortment of delicious and homely dishes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. <br>
    There are also vegetarian options and dishes catered toward children.
    </p>
 
    <h4>
    Chicken Salad Bowl Lunch Set, 1000 yen
   </h4>
    <p>
    The joint establishment of a coin laundry and cafe means that clothes are clean, and the food
    is clean. With the keyword of "healthy," we have a vegetable lunch (salad bowl) ready for you. 
    This is a fusion bowl inspired by New York salad bowls. Based on the vegetables from our 
    contracted farmers, Kyo-Yasai, give the crispy texture of the Western-style rice bowl a try! The
    Keema curry uses beans for meat, and food enthusiasts love our Bibimbap salad bowl, all of 
    which are vegetable-based. The KLC original cafe plate with a soup and drink included is available
    for lunch and dinner!
    </P>
   <h4> 
    Keema Curry Salad Bowl, 1000 yen
    </h4>
    <p>
    Our neighboring country of Korea has the wholesome Bibimbap, a dish that is great for our health!
    There probably aren't many cafes where you can eat Bibimbap. Have this healthy Bibimbap salad bowl 
    that is garnering a lot of attention and become energetic and beautiful. The neighboring kimchi and
    gochujang, made by Matsubara-san (who is Korean) is extraordinary.
</p>
<h4>
    Hamburger Lunch Set, 1000 yen
</h4>
<p>
    Double meat patties for lots of volume! Drizzled with Cobb sauce for a lighter flavored hamburger, 
    it's popular with the local foreigners too. With French fries and a drink included, this is perfect for a 
    light brunch. You can also take it to-go.
</p>
<h4>
    Omurice Meal Set, 1000 yen
</h4>
<p>
    Not the trendy fluffy egg omelets, but an omurice that the cafe has been serving since the past. The
    sauce is a homemade original demi glace sauce. The simple omurice is popular and fulfills the wishes
    of the regulars.
</p>
<h4>
    Hamburg Steak Lunch Set, 1000 yen
</h4>
<p>
    The hamburg steak is hotel restaurant-grade beef (150 grams and above). This was the menu cooked up
    for the gentlement to come back for. As intended, salarymen order it, and a cafe where
    you can eat your fill came into creation. We have confidence in the amount of meat! 
</p>
<h4>
    [ Dinner Only Menu ] 
    Chicken and Vegetable Oven-Bake Galore
</h4>
<p>
    Chicken and Kyoto vegetables cooked in a skillet then oven-baked, a menu to go with your beer. For people
    who are waiting for their laundry to finish and want a drink, or you want to have a nighttime glass of wine at a cafe, 
    this was the menu thought up for you. It's simply seasoned with olive oil and butter, but the herb chicken
    will surely satisfy your nightly cravings.
</p>
<h4>
    Blend Coffee, Flavored Drinks
</h4>
<p>
    Because it's a laundry cafe, they won't serve coffee? To prove this wrong, we offer espresso for a 
    pleasant coffee time. We use Brazilian and Sumatra coffee beans from the NY Brooklyn Company. 
    The staff have undergone barista training, and although not the best, please try a satisfying cup of
    coffee made with our treasured espresso machine, La Marzocco.
